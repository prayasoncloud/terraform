Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code (IAC) tool used to create, manage, and provision infrastructure resources. Here are some of the top Terraform commands that you'll frequently use:

1. terraform init: This command initializes a new or existing Terraform configuration. It downloads provider plugins and sets up the working directory for the Terraform project.

2. terraform plan: This command creates an execution plan that shows what Terraform will do when you apply your configuration. It's a crucial step for understanding the changes that will occur.

3. terraform apply: This command applies the changes described in the execution plan created by terraform plan. It's used to create or update resources as defined in your configuration.

4. terraform destroy: This command is used to destroy all the resources created by your configuration. It's often used to clean up resources after they are no longer needed.

5. terraform validate: This command checks the validity of your configuration files without creating or modifying any resources. It's useful for catching syntax errors and issues early in the development process.

6. terraform fmt: This command automatically formats your Terraform configuration files according to the Terraform style guide. It helps maintain a consistent code style.

7. terraform state: This subcommand allows you to perform operations on Terraform's state file, which tracks the current state of managed resources.

8. terraform import: This command is used to import existing infrastructure resources into your Terraform configuration. It allows you to manage resources that were created outside of Terraform.

9. terraform output: This command displays the values of output variables defined in your configuration. It's useful for retrieving information about resources created by Terraform.

10. terraform taint: This command marks a resource for recreation during the next terraform apply. It's useful when you want to force the recreation of a resource even if its configuration hasn't changed.

terraform workspace: This subcommand is used to manage multiple workspaces, which allow you to maintain different configurations or environments within a single project.

terraform show: This command provides a human-readable representation of the state or plan, making it easier to understand the current state of your infrastructure.
